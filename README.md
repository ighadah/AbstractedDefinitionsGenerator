In the commit: cycles between existential restrictions are detected, equivalences too (space, space)

By cycles I mean things like: r some A <= r some A, r some A in the RHS is removed. (space)
By equivalences I mean things like: r some A == r some B, r some A and r some B are both regarded as required restrictions in the abstracted definition.
